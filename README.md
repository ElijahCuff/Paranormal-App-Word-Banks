# Paranormal-App-Word-Banks
This project aims to shed light on paranormal communication apps, ghost boxes, random word generators etc... It helps to prove the legitimacy of claims made by app developers.

   
### Initial Findings    
- Microphone, Unfortunately most operating systems on mobile will automatically remove any noise in an audio recording stream, this is to emphasise voice and remove background noise - this is automatic and usually can not be bypassed withou an external hardware module - for Paranormal investigation, it is important that the audio being recorded is in RAW formzt, this is because "ghosts" communicate on a frequency that we can not hear; most of these Auto Noise removal systems will remove any audio from the recording that is there for no reason - like non vocal frequencies.      

- Camera, Simmilar downfalls exist for the image sensor on smartphones, in particular the Infrared Filters on the camera lens make it near impossible to capture light that is outside the visisble range of the naked eye, it is believed that "ghosts" manifest in video's and photo's because they can appear in Non Visible light spectrums like IR Infrared; Filtering Non Visible light helps to improve photo quality but not very useful for Paranormal Research.      

- Spirit Boxes, The FM Radio is not accesible to develpers and therfore the FM Radio can not even be accessed axcept where the manufacturer has released specific drivers for a system build, this makes the Live FM Radio very hard to develop for on smartphones: ultimately this results in needing to use IP Radio Scanning - IP Radio Scanning is supposed to be just as effective as Local Radio scanning for Spirit Boxes, so this could be an avenue.      

- Spirit Box V2 ( Random Phonics ), Some Spirit boxes use a database of the 44 Phonics in english to create a random sequence of phonics - these sequences sometimes result in not only full words, but sometimes full sentences and coherant conversations.

- EMF, Even though smartphones have a built-in compass with magnetic field sensor, The play store is loaded with fake EMF Detectors; EMF can be messured on smartphones using the sensor for magnetic fields. the purpuse behind this project is to demonstrate that these applications do not need to be faked.

- Random Word Generators, apparently random number generators have been "proven" to be manipulated by the mind - this is the basis behind spirit boxes that use random word generators ( if we can manipulate the outcome, so might ghosts )
  
- Random Sound Players, Very simmilar to Spirit Boxes randomly playing stations on the radio, these apps randomly play audio from a sound bank that doesnt contain actual words - many use the first 200 milliseconds of words and join them together randomly.

- Accelerometer, In many cases the most reliable feedback you could expect is feedback on movement - if a ghost can move a lamp, open a door or somehow move a physical object, motion detectors like the accelerometer in smartphones are the most likely option available for communication as the ghost can simply tap on the phone or walk nearby and vibration will set-off the motion detector.
